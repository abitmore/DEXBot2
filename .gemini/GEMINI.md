## Gemini Added Memories
- The user prefers to use gemini-3-flash as the standard model for the Gemini CLI.
- The user does not want to be prompted for commits; the agent should only commit when explicitly told to do so. The agent has permission to push changes.
- The agent must strictly follow explicit instructions and avoid making unsolicited changes. If extra improvements or issues are found, the agent must ask for permission before acting.
