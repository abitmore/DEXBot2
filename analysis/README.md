## Key Terms

Common abbreviations used throughout: OHLC, AMA, ER, ATR, Kalman, Hurst, PE, R, LIFO, FIFO, PnL, SMA, VWMA. Full definitions below.

<details><summary>Abbreviation glossary (click to expand)</summary>

| Term | Full name | Plain English |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| **OHLC** | Open, High, Low, Close | The four price points that describe each candle (bar) on a chart |
| **AMA** | Adaptive Moving Average | A trend line that speeds up in trending markets and slows down in choppy ones. AMA1–AMA4 are presets with different speeds. |
| **ER** | Efficiency Ratio | How directional price movement was in a period (0 = pure noise, 1 = straight line) |
| **ATR** | Average True Range | How much the price typically moves per bar — a volatility measure |
| **Kalman** | Kalman Filter | A mathematical filter that estimates the true trend by separating signal from noise |
| **Hurst** | Hurst Exponent | A number (0–1) that tells you if the market is trending (>0.5), mean-reverting (<0.5), or random (=0.5) |
| **PE** | Permutation Entropy | How unpredictable the price pattern is — low PE = orderly trend, high PE = chaos |
| **R** | Risk multiple | A trade's return measured in "average losing trade" units. A +3R trade earned 3× what a typical loser costs you. |
| **LIFO** | Last In, First Out | Sell the most recently bought asset first (matches grid-bot cycles) |
| **FIFO** | First In, First Out | Sell the oldest purchased asset first (conservative, reflects holding cost) |
| **PnL** | Profit and Loss | Net earnings from trading |
| **SMA** | Simple Moving Average | Average price over N bars — the basic trend line |
| **VWMA** | Volume-Weighted Moving Average | Like SMA but gives more weight to bars with higher volume |

</details>

## Quick Start

Two entry points, depending on what you're asking:

**"What's my bot doing right now?"** — pass a bot key from `profiles/bots.json`:

```bash
npm run analysis:tradingview -- --source market_adapter --bot-key <bot-key>
node dist/analysis/analyze_dynamic_weight.js --bot-key <bot-key>
```

**"How much money did my bot make?"** — pass a BitShares account ID or name:

```bash
npm run analysis:trade-pnl -- 1.2.123456 --hours 168
```

> The market adapter source reads from `market_adapter/state/market_adapter_centers.json` — run the bot first to populate state.
> Prefer the `npm run analysis:*` shortcuts; they wrap the compiled runners with the same flags (see [npm Script Shortcuts](#npm-script-shortcuts) for the full mapping).

## Data Prerequisites

Most runners expect candle data. Two paths to get it:

**Market adapter source** (default for most runners) — reads from `market_adapter/state/market_adapter_centers.json`. No setup needed; just run the bot first to populate state.

**LP candle files** — for deeper analysis with full OHLC data:

```bash
# Via the market adapter LP exporter (recommended for blockchain-backed candles)
node dist/market_adapter/inputs/fetch_lp_data.js --pool 133 --precA 4 --precB 5 --interval 1h --lookback 26280h

# Via the analysis fetcher (uses Kibana source directly)
node dist/analysis/ama_fitting/fetch_lp_candles.js --pool 1.19.133 \
  --assetA <ASSET_A> --assetAId <asset_a_id> --assetAPrecision <n> \
  --assetB <ASSET_B> --assetBId <asset_b_id> --assetBPrecision <n>
```

Placeholder key:

- `<pair>` — the asset-pair folder name under `market_adapter/data/lp/`.
- `<id>` — LP pool number you fetched with `--pool`.
- `<interval>` — candle interval, e.g. `1h`.
- `<ASSET_A>` / `<ASSET_B>` — asset symbols; `<asset_a_id>` / `<asset_b_id>` their `1.3.x` IDs; `<n>` their on-chain precision.

See [ama_fitting/README.md](ama_fitting/README.md) for full fetch options and data format.

## Trade & Portfolio Analysis

### Risk Profile Analyzer (`analyze_risk_profile.ts`)

Measures inventory risk by calculating empirical divergence quantiles (based on price-to-AMA deviation). Use this to calibrate 'Safe Range' clamping tiers for your liquidity strategy.

```bash
node dist/analysis/analyze_risk_profile.js --bot-key <bot-key>

# From explicit LP candle file
node dist/analysis/analyze_risk_profile.js \
  --file market_adapter/data/lp/<pair>/lp_pool_<id>_1h.json \
  --ama AMA3 \
  --output analysis/charts/risk_report.html
```

Metrics include:
- **Max Divergence:** Structural risk limit of the AMA preset.
- **Quantiles (99.9%, 99.99%, 99.999%):** Safe Range bounds for clamping tiers.
- **σ_ama_delta:** Std dev of per-bar AMA movement — use this to calibrate `AMA_DELTA_THRESHOLD_PERCENT`.

### Trade Profitability Analyzer (`trade_profitability.ts`)

Fetches `fill_order` operations for a BitShares account from Kibana within a specified time range, then computes realized PnL via sequential (LIFO) or FIFO inventory tracking per asset pair.

**Pipeline:** Kibana fill query → on-chain asset precision resolution → buy/sell classification → chronological matching (sequential LIFO by default) → per-pair summary + optional per-match detail.

```bash
# Account by ID, last 7 days (default)
node dist/analysis/trade_profitability.js 1.2.123456

# Account by name (auto-resolved in the background)
node dist/analysis/trade_profitability.js "my-account-name" --hours 720

# Absolute window with asset filter
node dist/analysis/trade_profitability.js 1.2.123456 \
  --start 2026-07-01 --end 2026-07-07 --asset 1.3.3291

# Export trade log and full analysis
node dist/analysis/trade_profitability.js 1.2.123456 \
  --hours 168 --csv trades.csv --json results.json

# Conservative accounting (FIFO)
node dist/analysis/trade_profitability.js 1.2.123456 \
  --hours 168 --match-mode fifo
```

<details><summary>Options (click to expand)</summary>

| `--fee-per-order <bts>` | `0.09652` | Blockchain fee per limit_order_create op (BTS); approximate |
| `--verbose` | off | Print per-pair trade counts during processing |

</details>

**Asset precision handling:**

1. Assets listed in the static `ASSETS` table (BTS, TWENTIX, XBTSX.*, HONEST.*, IOB.*, etc.) resolve instantly.
2. Unknown assets are resolved on-chain via `get_assets` when `--node` is provided, with results cached at runtime.
3. If no `--node` is given and an asset is unknown, the fill is **skipped** with a warning (no abort).

**PnL methodology:**

- **Ordering:** Trades within each pair are sorted chronologically (block number + operation index).
- **Lot tracking:** Buys add lots to an inventory queue.
- **LIFO (default):** Sells consume the newest lots first — matching the actual grid cycle where a buy at one level is sold at the next tick up.
- **FIFO:** Sells consume the oldest lots first, reflecting the real cost of carrying inventory through a trend.
- **Per-match PnL:** `(sellPrice − buyPrice) × matchedAmount`, reported in quote-asset units and as a percentage of the buy price.
- **Summary PnL%:** Uses volume-weighted average prices from matched lots only.
- **Unmatched sells:** Sells without a preceding buy in the window are surfaced in the pair summary.
- **Maker/taker flags:** The per-match detail table includes these for both the entry (buy) and exit (sell) legs, sourced from the blockchain operation.
- **Cross pairs:** For non-BTS pairs, assets are normalised by ordering the lower asset ID as base so buy/sell direction is consistent. PnL is reported in the pair's quote asset — a warning is shown when non-BTS quotes are present.
- **Programmatic use:** The script exports `analyzePair`, `classifyFills`, `computeMetrics`, and their TypeScript types.

**Metrics glossary** — `R` = the size of the average losing trade. A +3R trade earned 3× what a typical loser costs you.

<details><summary>Per-metric definitions (click to expand)</summary>

| Output line | Meaning |
|-------------|---------|
| `Win Rate` | % of trades that made money. Higher is better, but above 90% with small wins can hide tail risk. |
| `Profit Factor` | Total BTS won ÷ total BTS lost. Above 1.0 means you're profitable; above 2.0 is strong. |
| `Fee Drag` | % of gross profit eaten by blockchain order-creation fees. Lower = more efficient. |
| `Avg Win / Avg Loss` | Ratio of average winner size to average loser size. Above 1.0 means winners are bigger. |
| `Expectancy (gross)` | How much one trade is expected to earn before fees. Positive = edge exists. The `R` version normalises this by the average loss size (reports in R-multiples instead of BTS). The `net` version subtracts fees. |
| `Median R` | The middle R-multiple value (half of trades are above, half below). `>1R` / `>2R` = % of trades that earned more than 1× or 2× the average loss. `<-1R` = % that lost more than 1× the average loss. |
| `PnL distribution` | Median, P25, P75, Best, Worst — the centre, spread, and extremes of per-trade return %. Not annualised, just per cycle. |
| `Sharpe (ann)` | The window's net PnL per unit of volatility, annualised (`mean/std × √periods-per-year`). Binned daily for ≥ 3-day windows, hourly below; every period counts, flat ones as 0 PnL. Shown as `value ± estimation error [bin, n, confidence]` — short windows are low confidence, and only same-bin runs are comparable. Dimensionful (absolute PnL, not % returns). |
| `Sortino (ann)` | As Sharpe, but only losing periods feed the downside deviation. `∞` means the window had no losing periods. |
| `Projected net PnL` | Scored-window net PnL scaled linearly to a year (`÷ scored days × 365`) — same whole-period basis as Sharpe/Sortino, so a trailing partial period is excluded from both. A projection, not a forecast. |
| `Max Drawdown` | Largest peak-to-trough decline of the realised-PnL curve, in quote units (with the same decline as a % of peak cumulative profit). Realised only — open inventory isn't marked. |
| `Max Recovery Time` | Longest time (in days) from the deepest point of a drawdown back to a new equity high. |
| `Max Consecutive W/L` | Longest streak of winning or losing round-trips. Grouped by sell order, so one order covering multiple buy lots counts as one result. Grid bots naturally cluster wins during trends — streaks of 100-200 are not alarming. |
| `Avg hold time` | Average time (hours) between buying an asset and selling it. |
| `Maker / Taker` | % of trade legs (buys + sells combined) where the bot provided liquidity (maker, resting on the book) vs took it (taker). Higher maker % = lower fees. |
| `Sell orders filled` | Number of distinct sell orders that were filled in the period. |
| `Partial fills/order` | How many buy lots each sell order consumed (mean, median, max). For a grid bot: 2.0 median means half the orders clear 2 grid levels; 18 max means one big sweep. |
| `One-shot orders` | % of orders that matched exactly 1 buy lot. Low % = your grid is thick enough that orders routinely cover multiple levels. |
| `Fills/day` | Average matched lots per scored day, on the same whole-period basis as the ratios above. Raw activity speed. |
| `Avg vol/day` | Average daily trading volume in the quote asset over that same scored window. |

</details>

### Grid Correction Check (`grid_correction_check.ts`)

Validates grid discipline from the same Kibana fill pipeline as `trade_profitability.ts`: two consecutive same-direction fills on a pair must be monotonic — sell prices rising, buy prices falling (equal is OK). An inversion means the bot placed an order below its own previous sell (or above its own previous buy), e.g. an orphaned order filling outside grid accounting. Used as the external regression gate for the orphan-fix plans in `docs/CONSOLIDATED_ORPHAN_FIX_SUMMARY.md`.

**Pipeline:** Kibana `fill_order` query (paginated `search_after`) → on-chain asset precision resolution → buy/sell classification → chronological sort → per-order/price-epoch aggregation (partial fills at one price collapsed to weighted-average; repriced order lifetimes kept separate) → consecutive same-direction pair comparison → violation report with daily histogram.

```bash
# Per-order aggregated check (default), last 7 days
npm run analysis:grid-check -- --bot-key <bot-key> --hours 168

# 30 days, JSON + CSV export of violations
npm run analysis:grid-check -- --bot-key <bot-key> --hours 720 --json out.json --csv out.csv

# Raw fill granularity instead of per-order aggregation
npm run analysis:grid-check -- --bot-key <bot-key> --per-fill --hours 168

# Forgive small adverse moves within 0.1%
npm run analysis:grid-check -- --bot-key <bot-key> --hours 168 --tolerance 0.1
```

Exit code `0` = pass, `2` = violations found, `1` = fatal error. Bot keys resolve via `profiles/bots.json` (`--list-bots` to enumerate); the account defaults to the bot's stored `accountId` when present (no chain lookup — the ID is auto-saved next to `preferredAccount` after the first successful name resolution, re-verified with `--refresh-account`), otherwise `preferredAccount` is resolved on-chain, and can be overridden with `--account <1.2.x|name>`.

<details><summary>Options (click to expand)</summary>

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--bot-key <key>` | — | Bot key or name from `profiles/bots.json` (required) |
| `--hours <n>` | `168` | Lookback hours from now |
| `--start <iso>` / `--end <iso>` | — | Absolute time window |
| `--account <id>` | bot `preferredAccount` | Override account ID or name |
| `--lookup` | off | Legacy (no-op): account names always resolve via BitShares node when no stored ID exists |
| `--refresh-account` | off | Force re-resolution of `preferredAccount` and update the stored `accountId` when it changed |
| `--node <url>` | first built-in node | Node for account/asset resolution |
| `--per-fill` | off | Check at fill granularity instead of per-order aggregated |
| `--include-cross-pair` | off | Also check consecutive fills across different pairs |
| `--tolerance <pct>` | `0` | Adverse price move (%) forgiven before flagging |
| `--json <file>` / `--csv <file>` | — | Export violations |
| `--verbose` | off | Print the full trade sequence |
| `--list-bots` | — | List available bot keys and exit |

</details>

**Notes:** strict sat-level comparison is the ground truth (`--tolerance` only forgives small inversions); partial fills at one price are collapsed to a weighted-average price in the default mode, but fills after a native order repricing are kept in separate price epochs so updated orders are not mixed together.

## Charts & Visualization

### Trade Heatmap (`analyze_trade_heatmap.ts`)

</details>

### TradingView Chart (`tradingview/analyze_tradingview.ts`)

Generates a standalone TradingView-style HTML chart with candle OHLC, SMA, AMA, VWMA, and volume panel. See [tradingview/README.md](tradingview/README.md) for full documentation.

# Recommended one-step: bot, pool, or pair (fetches candles + renders, default 3 months)
dexbot tv <bot-key>
dexbot tv 133
dexbot tv TOKENA/TOKENB
dexbot tv BTS/HONEST.USD --feed  # opt-in: MPA price-feed history instead of market candles
# Manual: bot-key (auto-resolves candle file and AMA settings)
npm run analysis:tradingview -- --source market_adapter --bot-key <bot-key>

# From an explicit candle file
node dist/analysis/tradingview/analyze_tradingview.js \
  --file market_adapter/data/market_adapter_<bot-key>_1h.json \
  --chart analysis/charts/<pair>_tradingview.html
```

## Trend & Price Analysis

Two weight-tuning paths feed into the market adapter:

- **Asymmetric** — AMA slope + Kalman, gated by Hurst/PE regime. Shifts buy/sell weight bias.
- **Symmetric** — ATR volatility penalty. Reduces both weights equally in volatile markets.

### Dynamic Weight Research (`analyze_dynamic_weight.ts`)

Interactive 4-panel chart for the asymmetric path: AMA slope plus Kalman confirmation, gated by Hurst Exponent and Permutation Entropy. Use this when tuning buy/sell weight bias, AMA slope offset behavior, and regime damping.

```bash
node dist/analysis/analyze_dynamic_weight.js --bot-key <bot-key>

# From LP candle file with custom parameters
node dist/analysis/analyze_dynamic_weight.js \
  --file market_adapter/data/lp/<pair>/lp_pool_<id>_<interval>.json \
  --alpha 0.6 --gain 0.25 --clip 20
```

Full research docs: [DYNAMIC_WEIGHT_RESEARCH.md](trend_detection/DYNAMIC_WEIGHT_RESEARCH.md)

### Volatility (`analyze_volatility.ts`)

ATR-based symmetric volatility penalty. Use when both buy and sell weights are being reduced too much or too little.

```bash
node dist/analysis/analyze_volatility.js --bot-key <bot-key>
```

### Supporting sub-signals

The asymmetric path depends on three more filters; each ships as a standalone analyzer so you can diagnose the combined chart's sub-signals in isolation.

| Analyzer | Focus | Use when |
|----------|-------|----------|
| `analyze_regime.ts` | Hurst + PE regime classification | Trend signals need more or less regime damping |
| `analyze_regime_windows.ts` | Alternate Hurst / PE window configs | Regime gate is too slow or too noisy |
| `analyze_kalman.ts` | Kalman velocity / displacement | Isolating the Kalman side of the AMA / Kalman blend |

```bash
node dist/analysis/analyze_regime.js --bot-key <bot-key>
node dist/analysis/analyze_regime_windows.js --bot-key <bot-key>
node dist/analysis/analyze_kalman.js --bot-key <bot-key>

# All also accept explicit LP candle files
node dist/analysis/analyze_volatility.js \
  --file market_adapter/data/lp/<pair>/lp_pool_<id>_<interval>.json
node dist/analysis/analyze_regime.js \
  --file market_adapter/data/lp/<pair>/lp_pool_<id>_<interval>.json
node dist/analysis/analyze_kalman.js \
  --file market_adapter/data/lp/<pair>/lp_pool_<id>_<interval>.json
```

```bash
node dist/analysis/trend_detection/tests/test_kalman_trend.js
node dist/analysis/trend_detection/tests/test_kalman_velocity_smoothing.js
```

**Note:** `trend_detection/` has no external dependencies — runs directly from the compiled build (`node dist/...`).

### `ama_fitting/`

AMA parameter optimization and comparison tools.

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `optimizer_high_resolution.ts` | AMA parameter optimizer (erPeriod, fast/slow bounds) |
| `generate_unified_comparison_chart.ts` | AMA comparison chart (defaults from constants, use optimizer for fitted params) |
| `analyze_ama_price_changes.ts` | AMA price-change analysis |
| `fetch_lp_candles.ts` | LP candle data fetcher |
| `calibrate_convergence_er.ts` | Calibrate AMA_CONVERGENCE_ER_AVG from LP data |

The AMA implementation itself lives at `market_adapter/core/strategies/ama.ts`.

**Calibration workflow (ER convergence):**

`calibrate_convergence_er.ts` computes the Efficiency Ratio that reproduces the real average smoothing constant (SC) from LP candle data.

Averaging ER first and then applying the SC formula gives a smaller number than applying the formula bar-by-bar and averaging — so the simple mean ER undersells true convergence speed. The tool computes the value the right way.

The current fetched 3-year pool 133 1h dataset calibrates `AMA_CONVERGENCE_ER_AVG` to `0.151`.

```bash
# Default data file (pool 133 1h)
node dist/analysis/ama_fitting/calibrate_convergence_er.js

# Custom data, specific AMAs
node dist/analysis/ama_fitting/calibrate_convergence_er.js \
  --data market_adapter/data/lp/<path>/<file>.json \
  --amas AMA1,AMA3
```

**Note:** `ama_fitting/` has no external dependencies — runs directly from the compiled build (`node dist/...`).

### `bot_fitting/`

Parameter sweep backtests that simulate grid fills for the AMA winners from `ama_fitting/`. Optimizes spread, increment, and max/min ratio for each AMA strategy.

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `backtest_bot_fitting.ts` | Lightweight sweep across spread / increment / ratio with basic risk scoring |
| `backtest_ama_sweep.ts` | Persistent grid simulation with fixed-chain-price mechanics, reposition thresholds, and worker-thread parallelization |
| `shared_utils.ts` | Candle normalization and shared backtest utilities |

```bash
node dist/analysis/bot_fitting/backtest_bot_fitting.js \
  --data market_adapter/data/lp/<pair>/lp_pool_<id>_<interval>.json
```

```bash
node dist/analysis/bot_fitting/backtest_ama_sweep.js \
  --data market_adapter/data/lp/<pair>/lp_pool_<id>_<interval>.json \
  --spread 4:16:1 --increment 0.5:4:0.25

## npm Script Shortcuts

These npm scripts wrap common analysis runners:

| Script | Command |
|--------|---------|
| `npm run analysis:tradingview` | `node dist/analysis/tradingview/analyze_tradingview.js` |
| `npm run analysis:trade-pnl` | `node dist/analysis/trade_profitability.js` |
| `npm run analysis:grid-check` | `node dist/analysis/grid_correction_check.js` |
| `npm run analysis:derivatives` | `node dist/analysis/analyze_derivatives.js` (legacy SMA/MACD/RSI layer, reference only) |
| `npm run ama:chart:lp-local` | `node dist/analysis/ama_fitting/generate_unified_comparison_chart.js` (chart also auto-generated by optimizer) |

All accept `--` forwarded flags.

```bash
# Bot-key shortcuts
npm run analysis:tradingview -- --source market_adapter --bot-key <bot-key>

# Trade PnL
npm run analysis:trade-pnl -- 1.2.123456 --hours 720

# Grid correction check (monotonicity regression gate)
npm run analysis:grid-check -- --bot-key <bot-key> --hours 168

# File-based
